// These are the following test examples to test the new functions.

// Testing for the forward message function:
1
#
hello world!
h
// The message has been left in the first mailbox.
1
#
1
#
1
// Now in the message menu
// Test the original use case.
// Forward it to mailbox #2
4
2
#
// Message should be in mailbox #2.
// Hang up and check mailbox #2.
h
2
#

#
1
1
// Should play “hello world!”
// Now let’s try forwarding to an invalid mailbox.
// We are still in the message menu.
4
1
0
0
#
// We should get the message about the mailbox number being invalid.
// Now let’s try returning to the message menu.
0
#
// We should be in the message menu. Let’s try hanging up while 
// in the forward message state (it should just reset the connection).
4
h
// We have reset the connection. Now to try forwarding a message
// when the mailbox has no messages.
3
#
3
#
1
1 // This is just to show that the mailbox is empty
4
// It should say there is no message to forward.
q
// End of testing the forward message function.


// Testing for the broadcast a message to all mailboxes:
